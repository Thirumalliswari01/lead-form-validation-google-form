# Lead Form Validation Project 📝

This project implements a **dynamic** and **user-friendly** form validation system for a lead generation form using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides **real-time validation** for various form fields such as **company size**, **budget**, **industry**, and **urgency**. The form dynamically shows and hides validation messages based on user input, improving the user experience and guiding them to fill out the form correctly. 🚀

## 🌟 Features:
- ✅ Real-time form validation on form submission.
- ❌ Hides validation messages when inputs are corrected by the user.
- 💬 Specific error messages for each field (company size, budget, industry, and urgency).
- 🎯 Interactive form with smooth validation flow using JavaScript event listeners.
- ✨ Customizable validation messages.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the form.
- **CSS**: For styling and formatting the form and validation messages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and form validation functionality.

## ⚙️ How it works:
- The form validates fields (company size, budget, industry, and urgency) when submitted. ✅
- If any required field is left empty, a corresponding error message is shown. ❗
- If a user clicks a radio button, any visible validation messages related to that field are hidden. 👌

## 🏁 Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thirumalliswari01/lead-form-validation-google-form.git


### Key Updates:
- Added emojis to make the README more visually appealing and engaging.
